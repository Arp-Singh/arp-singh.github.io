Everyone has a tech log nowadays and I thought to myself, why shouldn't I?

# What should you expect from this blog?

You can expect to see the following:


* **[EXPLORATION]** denotes a new concept I'm currently exploring.
* **[INSIGHT]** denotes something I have learned through research or practical means.
* **[PROJECT]** denotes a project that I am currently working on, which will feature a link to the project.

There will be some special articles every now and again that are denoted by **[OFF-TOPIC]**. These will be not necessarily be related to anything technical but more of a personal nature. Things like games, cooking/baking and anything related to me as a person.

**So if you enjoyed what you heard, then why not RSS the blog?**


*Have lovely day, as always!*

*Signing off,*
